	<h2>Americano</h2>
	<img src="./imeges/americano.jpg" alt="">
	<div class="text">
		<p>Caffè Americano also known as Americano or American;  is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added. The name is also spelled with varying capitalization and use of diacritics: e.g., café americano.</p>

	<h2>Espresso</h2>
	<img src="./imeges/espresso.jpeg" alt="">
	<div class="text">
		<p>Espresso is coffee of Italian origin, brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure  through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency). As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. Espresso is also the base for other drinks such as a caffè latte, cappuccino, caffè macchiato, caffè mocha, flat white, or caffè Americano.</p>

	<h2>Latte</h2>

	<div class="text">
		<p>A latte  is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.The term as used in English is a shortened form of the Italian caffè e latte, caffelatte  or caffellatte , which means "milk coffee". The word is also sometimes spelled latté or lattè in English with different kinds of accent marks, which can be a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced according to the rules of English orthography.</p>

	<h2>Ristretto</h2>
	<img src="./imeges/ristretto.jpg" alt="">
	<div class="text">
		<p>Ristretto is traditionally a short shot of espresso coffee made with the normal amount of ground coffee but extracted with about half the amount of water in the same amount of time by using a finer grind. This produces a concentrated shot of coffee per volume. Just pulling a normal shot short could be confused as a Ristretto, however, it is not a Ristretto, only a weaker shot.[1] The opposite of a ristretto is a lungo, which is typically double the shot volume. Ristretto means “shortened” or “narrow” in Italian whereas lungo means “long.” The French equivalent of ristretto is café serré.</p>
